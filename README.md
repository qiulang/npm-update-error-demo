`npm update axios` failed to update `axios`

Check here for the details  [Why did npm update fail to update but npm uninstall then install can?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72441858/why-did-npm-update-fail-to-update-but-npm-uninstall-then-install-can)

But even if I just have one dependency axios, `npm update axios` still failed to update
and I used the latest npm 8.11.0

```json
  "dependencies": {
    "axios": "^0.19.2"
  },
```
